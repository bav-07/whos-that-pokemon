# Update 21.01.23
## Fixes
- Now returns all Pok&eacute;mon up to Generation 8, including new Pok&eacute;mon introduced in Legends Arceus

## Known Issues

- Does not cover all Pok&eacute;mon, as not all Pok&eacute;mon have official artwork yet (the release of Gen IX was recent)
- Certain Pok&eacute;mon are named based on their form: for example, the original Tornadus is named `tornadus-incarnate` and it's alternate form is `tornadus-therian`: the input currently only works if you type the name in *exactly* as it is recorded in the API; will look into improving on that functionality
- Pokemon turns into silhouette before new one is generated
